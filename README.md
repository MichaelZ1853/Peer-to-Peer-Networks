# Peer-to-Peer-Networks
A program where two machines can synchronize and share files in the same network (LAN). 

For the server IP address in client.py, you have to change it to your server's IP address so that it can run on your client end.
Also, the peer-to-peer may not work properly due to debugging and configuration on one node rather than two nodes. The data passing between the two nodes is why it can't work. As I was fixing synchronization of adding and deleteing, I ran out of time updating the program to work with two nodes.

Overall, the synchronization as stated earlier works with all types of files and connection between the server and client works. Running both client and server on one computer should work.
